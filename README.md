# Tools

## Introduction

Tools that solve some specific needs that I have. Please feel free to open a PR for fixes or improvements :)

## Scope

These tools aim to solve some needs I have, so they don't plan to cover all possible scenarios, platforms, configurations, etc.

If our needs align and there's anything you'd like to add to these tools, PRs are welcome! However, I'd like to keep these tools in scope, so please let's keep the changes simple.
