## Introduction
Batteries usually maximise their lifespan if they are kept within the 20%-80% charge level.

This tools aims to help making that task easier!

- If your battery level is <= 20%, send a notification, letting you know that you should charge your laptop.
- If your battery level is >= 80%, send a notification, letting you know that you should unplug your laptop.

## Scope
